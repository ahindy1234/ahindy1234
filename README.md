## 🧐 About
I’m a first year student at Stanford University pursuing a Bachelor’s Degree in Symbolic Systems with a specialization in AI systems. I have 4 years of experience with machine learning and 1 year of experience with quantum computing projects. Some of my projects include:

 - Identifying segmented nuclei using convolutional neural networks to help doctors diagnose disease
 - Predicting droughts using novel machine learning techniques and computer vision
 - Translating sign language using muscle sensors and seq-2-seq models for neural sign language translation
 - Implementing quantum error correcting codes on IBM’s Melbourne computer to measure systemic errors.

I’m interested in learning more about CS, physics, and software engineering as well as expanding my knowledge in the field. I love expanding my knowledge and skills in these fields and do so whenever I can. In my free time, I enjoy blogging, making Youtube videos, working on open source projects, squash, running, and reading.
