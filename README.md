### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Ali and Iâ€™m a student at Stanford University pursuing a Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Symbolic Systems with a specialization in AI systems. I have 4 years of experience with machine learning and 1 year of experience with quantum computing projects. Some of my projects include:

- Identifying segmented nuclei using convolutional neural networks to help doctors diagnose disease
- Predicting droughts using novel machine learning techniques and computer vision
- Translating sign language using muscle sensors and seq-2-seq models for neural sign language translation
- Implementing quantum error correcting codes on IBMâ€™s Melbourne computer to measure systemic errors.

Iâ€™m interested in learning more about CS, physics, and software engineering as well as expanding my knowledge in the field. I love expanding my knowledge and skills in these fields and do so whenever I can. In my free time, I enjoy blogging, making Youtube videos, working on open source projects, squash, running, and reading.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on implementing deep learning models for Neural Sign Language Translation! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Science, PHP, and Full Stack Development
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on web development projects or any open source machine learning projects.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with deep learning models. I'm always trying to learn more and I consider anyone a teacher!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my golf game.
